### 3. Recommendation Algorithm Engine

**File:** `/src/lib/recommendations.ts` (140 lines)

**Smart Algorithms:**

#### A. getFrequentlyBoughtTogether()
```typescript
Priority 1: Same category products (complementary stacks)
Priority 2: Related category products
Sort by: Price (lower ‚Üí higher for upsell opportunity)
Returns: 2 suggested products
```

#### B. getYouMayAlsoLike()
```typescript
Priority 1: Products on sale (compareAtPrice exists)
Priority 2: Related categories
Priority 3: Same category
Sort by: Price similarity to current product
Returns: 6 recommended products
```

#### C. getComplementaryProducts()
```typescript
Smart category mapping:
- supplements ‚Üí wearables, blue-light-glasses
- nootropics ‚Üí blue-light-glasses, wearables
- performance ‚Üí wearables, recovery
- recovery ‚Üí performance, supplements
```

#### D. calculateBundleDiscount()
```typescript
3+ items = 15% off
2 items = 10% off
1 item = 0% off
```

**Category Relationship Matrix:**
```
supplements     ‚Üî nootropics, performance, recovery
nootropics      ‚Üî supplements, performance, blue-light-glasses
performance     ‚Üî supplements, nootropics, recovery, wearables
recovery        ‚Üî performance, supplements
blue-light      ‚Üî nootropics, supplements
wearables       ‚Üî performance, supplements
```

---

### 4. Product Page Integration

**Modified:** `/src/app/products/[slug]/page.tsx`

**Added Imports:**
```typescript
import { FrequentlyBoughtTogether } from '@/components/catalog/FrequentlyBoughtTogether'
import { YouMayAlsoLike } from '@/components/catalog/YouMayAlsoLike'
import { getFrequentlyBoughtTogether, getYouMayAlsoLike } from '@/lib/recommendations'
import { getAllProducts } from '@/lib/mock-data'
```

**Recommendation Logic:**
```typescript
const allProducts = getAllProducts()
const frequentlyBoughtTogether = getFrequentlyBoughtTogether(product, allProducts, 2)
const youMayAlsoLike = getYouMayAlsoLike(product, allProducts, 6)
```

**Placement:**
- Location: Between FAQ section and Subscription Savings calculator
- Conditional rendering: Only shows if recommendations exist
- Responsive containers with max-width constraints

---

### 5. Global CSS Enhancements

**Modified:** `/src/app/globals.css`

**Added Utilities:**
```css
/* Hide scrollbar for Chrome, Safari and Opera */
.scrollbar-hide::-webkit-scrollbar {
  display: none;
}

/* Hide scrollbar for IE, Edge and Firefox */
.scrollbar-hide {
  -ms-overflow-style: none;  /* IE and Edge */
  scrollbar-width: none;  /* Firefox */
}
```

**Purpose:** Smooth carousel scrolling without visible scrollbar
