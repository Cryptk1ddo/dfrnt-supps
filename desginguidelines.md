# DFRNT — Brand Design Code

**Purpose:** A compact, actionable design code to guide every visual and verbal expression of the DFRNT brand — from clothing and packaging to web, social, and community touchpoints. Built to balance two faces: the bold, rebellious *DFRNT Line* and the quiet, timeless *Sovereign Line*.

---

## 1. Brand Essence

**Core promise:** Empower high-drive individuals to be different with dignity — aesthetic systems that signal power, autonomy, and refined rebellion.

**Brand pillars:**

* **Authority:** expert, decisive, credible.
* **Sovereignty:** understated wealth, quiet power.
* **Rebel charisma:** attention-grabbing, showman energy when appropriate.
* **Craft & Materiality:** elevated textiles and tactile details.

**Target audience:** High-drive entrepreneurs, 28–45, style-forward, time-poor, status-conscious but privately selective.

**Primary tone of voice:** Warm expert — confident, slightly provocative, never crass.

---

## 2. Logo System

**Primary wordmark:** "DFRNT" — bold, all-caps, tight tracking. Use for hero placements and product tags.

**Secondary mark (monogram):** Stylized "DF" ligature for caps, embossing, zipper pulls, and favicons.

**Lockups:**

* Wordmark alone (primary)
* Monogram (secondary)
* Wordmark + descriptor (e.g., DFRNT • Sovereign Line)

**Clearspace:** Minimum clearspace = half x of the capital letter height (0.5×). Keep all other elements outside this area.

**Minimum sizes:**

* Print: 12 mm width for wordmark
* Screen: 48 px width for wordmark

**Color variations:**

* Full Black on light backgrounds
* Inverse (white or off-white) on black/dark backgrounds
* Accent red-orange for emphasis only (never as a full-brand background)

**File formats to keep:** SVG (primary), PDF (print), PNG (screens), EPS (legacy print).

---

## 3. Color Palette

Primary:

* **Black** — #000000 (dominant)
* **Jet Graphite** — #1F1F1F (supporting dark)

Accent:

* **Red‑Orange (DFRNT Accent)** — #FF4A1A (use for CTA, tags, small details)

Neutrals:

* **Off‑White** — #F7F6F5 (backgrounds, paper)
* **Warm Grey** — #BDB9B6 (subtext, muted elements)

Usage rules:

* Black is the primary backdrop — heavy, luxurious, and authoritative.
* Accent red‑orange is used sparingly: call-to-action, stitches, piping, trims, small type highlights.
* Avoid saturated color blocks of red‑orange; prefer small pops (buttons, interior linings, tag edges).

Contrast & accessibility:

* Always ensure text-on-background contrast ≥ 4.5:1 for body copy. Use Jet Graphite for large text on Off‑White when Black is visually harsh.

---

## 4. Typography

**Primary (Brand & UI):** Inter (variable) or Helvetica Neue.

* Weights: 400 (regular), 600 (semibold), 800 (extra bold)
* Use for UIs, body copy, captions, product descriptions.

**Display / Luxury (Sovereign Line):** Playfair Display or a high-contrast serif.

* Use for headlines, editorial spreads, packaging headlines.

**Styling rules:**

* Headlines: All-caps or Title Case depending on context. Use tight tracking for wordmark-like authority.
* Body copy: Sentence case, relaxed leading (1.4x), maximum comfortable measure ~65–75 characters.
* Microcopy (tags, labels): Uppercase small caps for product tags.

**Type scale (web guideline):**

* H1: 48–56px
* H2: 32–40px
* H3: 24–28px
* Body: 16px
* Small: 12–14px

**Web font stack examples:**

* `font-family: "Inter", system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif;`
* `font-family: "Playfair Display", Georgia, serif;`

---

## 5. Grid, Layout & Composition

**Grid:** 12-column responsive grid. Max content width 1200–1400px for web; generous gutters.

**Margins & Rhythm:**

* Generous negative space around hero elements. Luxury thrives on breathing room.
* Use asymmetrical layouts for the DFRNT Line: cropped photography, diagonal cuts, layered text.
* Sovereign Line uses centered, balanced compositions with consistent margins.

**Hierarchy:**

* Contrast size, weight, and color to create clear reading paths. Accent color reserved for action.

---

## 6. Imagery & Photography

**Style:** Cinematic, high-contrast, low-saturation overall with deep blacks and selective warm highlights — skin tones naturally rendered, backgrounds desaturated.

**Subjects:** Powerful single figures, decisive gestures, tactile close-ups (stitching, fabric weave, zipper, clasp), urban nocturne backdrops, private interiors (study, bar).

**Lighting:** Directional rim lighting, shallow depth of field for portraits, moody shadows for drama.

**Composition cues:**

* Use off‑center framing and negative space for DFRNT Line.
* For Sovereign: classic thirds, balanced headroom, neutral palettes.

**Color grading:** Desaturate non-essentials; allow the red‑orange accent to remain saturated when present.

---

## 7. Patterns, Textures & Materials

**Patterns:**

* Disrupted diagonal stripes for DFRNT Line (variable thickness), used as small tags or internal lining pattern.
* Minimal pinstripe or micro-herringbone for Sovereign Line.

**Textures:**

* Cotton-silk sheen (as requested for black T-shirt) — soft, slight luster for premium feel.
* Matte leather, brushed metal, heavy-weight paper (uncoated) for packaging.

**Embossing / Finishes:**

* Use blind deboss for subtlety on Sovereign packaging.
* Spot UV only for small areas on product cards; avoid glossy full-surface coatings.

---

## 8. Iconography & UI Elements

**Style:** Minimal, geometric strokes, 2px baseline stroke weight. Glyphs should be slightly condensed to echo the compact wordmark.

**Buttons:**

* Primary (on dark): Outline or subtle glass effect with small red‑orange indicator.
* Secondary: Text-only, uppercase microcopy.

**Forms & Inputs:**

* Ample padding, rounded corners 6–8px, clear labels, left-aligned.

---

## 9. Tone of Voice & Copy

**Voice attributes:** Confident, concise, warm-expert, occasionally provocative.

**Examples:**

* Product launch headline (DFRNT Line): “Wear the contradiction.”
* Product copy (Sovereign): “Understated power, exacted in cloth.”
* CTA (primary): “Claim Yours” / “Join DFRNT”

**Microcopy rules:**

* Use short sentences. Prioritize verbs and benefits. Avoid filler.
* Use contractions selectively to sound human but retain authority.

---

## 10. Applications & Use Cases

**Clothing tags:** Monogram on one side; wordmark + product code on the second. Use matte black card stock with blind deboss; red‑orange edge paint optional.

**Packaging:** Minimal black box, off-white tissue, red‑orange ribbon or piping inside. Use product cards with Playfair Display headline and Inter body.

**Website:** Dark-first aesthetic, hero imagery with large negative space, product pages that highlight fabric details, microcopy for expected delivery and materials.

**Social:** Carousel templates (3–5 cards) — bold headline (H1), cinematic image, 1–2 sentence caption, CTA card in red‑orange.

**Email:** Plain layout, generous leading, black or off‑white background depending on campaign. Accent color used for buttons only.

---

## 11. Accessibility & Practical Constraints

**Contrast:** Text on black should often be off‑white (#F7F6F5) for legibility. Ensure 4.5:1 contrast for body text.

**Print:** Avoid extremely fine hairlines (<0.25pt). Emboss/deboss tolerances: test with manufacturer.

**Digital:** Provide high-res artboards at 2× for retina displays.

---

## 12. Do's & Don'ts

**Do:**

* Use large areas of black with very controlled pops of red‑orange.
* Prioritize tactile finishes in packaging and tags.
* Keep layouts generous; let elements breathe.

**Don't:**

* Use red‑orange as a full-page background.
* Overuse bold type for small text.
* Mix too many display typefaces — keep to the two recommended families.

---

## 13. Assets & Export Specs

**Logos:** Provide SVG (clean vectors), PNG 300 dpi for print comps, EPS for legacy printers.

**Color swatches:** Include Pantone matches for print: Black = Pantone Black 6 C, Red‑Orange ~ PMS 1655 C (confirm with print tests).

**Naming convention:** `DFRNT_<asset>_<variant>_v1.svg` (e.g., `DFRNT_wordmark_inverse_v1.svg`).
