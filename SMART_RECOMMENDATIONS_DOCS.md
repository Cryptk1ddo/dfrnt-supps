### 3. Recommendation Engine

**File:** `/src/lib/recommendations.ts`

#### Algorithms:

**1. getFrequentlyBoughtTogether()**
```typescript
Priority 1: Same category products
Priority 2: Related category products
Sort by: Price (lower → higher for upsell)
Returns: 2 products
```

**2. getYouMayAlsoLike()**
```typescript
Priority 1: Products on sale (compareAtPrice exists)
Priority 2: Related categories
Priority 3: Same category
Sort by: Price similarity to current product
Returns: 6 products
```

**3. getComplementaryProducts()**
```typescript
Map complementary categories:
- supplements → wearables, blue-light-glasses
- nootropics → blue-light-glasses, wearables
- performance → wearables, recovery
```

**4. calculateBundleDiscount()**
```typescript
3+ items = 15% off
2 items = 10% off
1 item = 0% off
```

#### Category Relationships:
```typescript
supplements ↔ nootropics, performance, recovery
nootropics ↔ supplements, performance, blue-light-glasses
performance ↔ supplements, nootropics, recovery, wearables
recovery ↔ performance, supplements
blue-light-glasses ↔ nootropics, supplements
wearables ↔ performance, supplements
```
