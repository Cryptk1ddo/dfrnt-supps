### 🧠 **Personalization Logic**

#### Recommendation Algorithm:
```
recommendation_key = ${goal}-${experience}-${lifestyle}-${budget}
```

**Example Keys:**
- `cognitive-beginner-professional-starter` → Focus Essentials
- `energy-intermediate-active-optimized` → Performance Athlete Bundle
- `sleep-advanced-professional-optimized` → Sleep Mastery System
- `performance-advanced-entrepreneur-complete` → Total Sovereignty Stack

**Fallback**: If combination not found, returns "Recommended Performance Stack" (default)

#### Smart Recommendations:
Each recommendation includes:
- **Title**: Descriptive bundle name
- **Products Array**: 1-4 products with name, price, image
- **Description**: Personalized explanation (2-3 sentences)
- **Savings**: Bundle discount messaging

**Example Recommendation:**
```typescript
{
  title: 'Performance Athlete Bundle',
  products: [
    { name: 'Energy Stack', price: '$89', image: '...' },
    { name: 'Recovery Stack', price: '$79', image: '...' }
  ],
  description: 'Fuel intense training with sustained energy and accelerated recovery protocols.',
  savings: 'Bundle discount: Save $25'
}
```

## Component Architecture

### File: `/src/components/quiz/ProductFinderQuiz.tsx`
**Lines**: 350+ (increased from 240)

### State Management:
```typescript
const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(0)           // 0-3 (4 questions)
const [answers, setAnswers] = useState<Record<string, string>>({})  // Stores all answers
const [showResults, setShowResults] = useState(false)       // Toggle results view
const [selectedOption, setSelectedOption] = useState<string | null>(null)  // Visual feedback
```

### Key Functions:

#### `handleAnswer(value: string)`
1. Set `selectedOption` for visual feedback
2. Wait 300ms (animation delay)
3. Store answer in state
4. Advance to next question OR show results
5. Reset `selectedOption`

#### `goBack()`
- Decrements `currentStep`
- Resets `selectedOption`
- Allows users to change previous answers

#### `getRecommendation()`
- Constructs key from 4 answers
- Looks up recommendation object
- Returns default if no match

#### `calculateTotalPrice(products: any[])`
- Parses price strings (`$79` → `79`)
- Sums all product prices
- Returns total for display

#### `resetQuiz()`
- Resets all state to initial values
- Returns to question 1
- Clears selected option
